Umm, after watching a TED speech, about _how to become a better conversationalist?_. I think, I should write some points.

The title is _How to talk and how to listen_.

This suggestions is not recommended.

> Look the person in the eye,think of interesting topics to discuss in advance;
> Look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention;
> Repeat back what you just heard or summarize it;
> Forget all of that, it is crap.
> etc.

The speaker thinks _There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention, if you're in fact paying attention. You just choose one of them and master it._

1. Don't multitask.
    * be present, be in that moment.
    * don't be half in it and half out of it.
2. Don't pontificate.
3. Use open-ended questions.
4. Go with the flow.
5. If you don't know, say that you don't know.
6. Don't equate your experience with theirs.
    * All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you.
7. Try not to repeat yourself.
8. Stay out of the weeds.
    * Frankly, people don't care the details.
9. Listen.
    * Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intend to reply.
10. Be frief.

That's all.
